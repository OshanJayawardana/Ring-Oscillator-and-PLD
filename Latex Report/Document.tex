\section{Parasitic effect in Timing analysis}
\textbf{Objective}: \textit{Design a 3 stage (3 inverters) ring oscillator. Find the correlation of the parasitic effect in the oscillation period.}\\

\subsection{System Design}
Ring oscillator is a unstable, closed loop device with a negative feedback. It consists of an \textbf{\textit{odd number of identical inverters (NOT gates)}} and its output oscillates between\textbf{\textit{ two voltage levels}} identified as high nad low. The period of oscillation($T$) of a ring oscillaotr can be expressed as follows where $n$ is the number of cascaded NOT gates and $\tau_{PD}$ is the propagation delay of a single inverter.

\[
T = 2.n.\tau_{PD}
\]
