	abstract = {A common use for LTSpice® is to run a time domain transient analysis where a parameter (e.g. voltage or current) can be plotted against time. Occasionally, you may wish to know the behavior of a circuit versus another parameter such as resistance. This can be done by using the “.measure” and “.step” SPICE directives along with the SPICE Error Log.O},
