[09:52, 03/05/2021]

You are suppose to submit the following files in a zip folder along with the group number. The group number will be provided soon

1 A report 
- the index number and group number as cover page
- 2nd page with contributions of each member
- Waveform, results, discussion (problems faced and how to overcome them , mathematical calculations if any)

2. Simulation files indicating the question number


Deadline is on this Friday 7th  of May. Viva may be postponed according to sir
<br>

As we discussed you have to submit your reports for the following part
on or before 7th May 2021.

Circuit 1: Parasitic effect in Timing analysis (evaluated to 15 marks)
Design a 3 stage (3 inverters) ring oscillator. Find the correlation of
the parasitic effect in the oscillation period.

Circuit 2: PLD ( evaluated to 35 marks)
Part 1: Design a programable logic block to configure it as a 'NAND' or
a 'NOR' gate using a single selection bit. (10 marks)<br>
Part 2: Design a single switch matrix using six pass transistors. (10
marks)<br>
Part 3: Design a PLD that can be used to design any 3 input
combinational circuit. (15 marks)<br>

You have to submit a report including task division among the group
members, waveforms and mathematics calculations for each circuit
including discussions.
